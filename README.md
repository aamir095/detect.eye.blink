# Eye Blinking EEG Signal Analysis Using Brain Computer Interface Devices 

Abstract‚Äî In this paper, electroencephalogram signals were acquired and analyzed during different physical activities like rest, anger, and eye blinking. The eye blinking artifact in electroencephalogram signal is studied and analyzed. For this purpose, an Open-Source Brain-Computer Interface device is used for the acquisition of electroencephalogram signals from a single subject (me). The brain waves were acquired at a regular interval, and around 142 instances of eyeblinks were recorded. Eyeblinks preprocessing was done in MATLAB using Butterworth filters. I have developed the algorithm to find the duration of eye blink using MATLAB. Also, I have applied various techniques like Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Machine Learning Algorithm (Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Algorithms) to determine the EEG signals were eyeblink signals or not. Among all the techniques and algorithms, Random Forest Classifier has the highest accuracy.

## Introduction
The human brain is one the most complex system found in our body, and an exacting task to understand the brain, brainwaves. Different techniques have been evolved from past to understand the brainwaves. Among them the most used technique is Electroencephalogram. Both invasive and non-invasive EEG recording have an increasing role in neuroscience and brain computer devices interfaces. The invasive devices should be inserted in brain by surgery while non-invasive devices can be easily fit into the scalp. Using non- invasive devices is a simple and fast process to analyzing the brain activities. However, signal quality from invasive devices is 20 to above 100 times better than the simultaneously obtained from non-invasive devices [1]. While dealing with eye blink and movements EEG signals, the use of non-invasive devices has significant signal quality as compared to the invasive devices. Comparing blink related artifacts in non-invasive and invasive EEG, simultaneously recorded from prefrontal and motor cortical regions using an approach suitable for detection of small artifact contamination. As expected, it is found that blinks to cause pronounced artifacts in non-invasive EEG both above prefrontal and motor cortical regions [1]. In this experiment we have used non-invasive devices from OPENBCI and Emotiv to analyze brainwaves. We are more focused in analyzing brain activities due to eye movements and controlling other devices like RC car, drone using brain waves.

EEG signal is bio-potential generated from brain activities, represented as voltage (very small in magnitude) fluctuations from ionic movement of neurons within the brain [2]. Depending on brain activities different magnitude and frequency of signals are generated from brain. The amplitude of the EEG signals ranges between 10 - 200 V with a frequency falling in the range 0.5 - 40Hz. EEG waveform is classified into five different frequency bands (alpha, beta, theta, delta, and gamma bands) [3]. Delta (ùõø) waves (0.5 -4Hz) are the slowest EEG waves, normally detected during the deep and unconscious sleep. Theta (∆ü) waves (4 - 8Hz) are observe- d during some states of sleep and quiet focus. Alpha (Œ±) band (8 - 14Hz) originates during periods of relaxation with eyes closed but still awake. Beta (Œ≤) band (14 - 30Hz) originates during normal consciousness and active concern- traction. Finally, Gamma (Œ≥) waves (over 30Hz) are known to have stronger electrical signals in response to visual stimulation. Fig.1 shows the five frequency bands of EEG signal. Different acquisition protocols have been tested for human recognition tasks such as relaxation with eye closed, EEG recordings based on visual stimuli, and performing mental tasks. In this paper we analyze the eye moment activities and corresponding signals generated from the brain. 
The brain-waves signals are extracted, and signal processed from BCI devices. The processed signal is transferred to the computer via Bluetooth, or any medium and feature selection processed of obtained discrete signal is handled with MATLAB. Figure 2 shows the proposed block diagram of the system. The eyeball acts as a dipole with a positive pole oriented anteriorly (cornea) and a negative pole oriented posteriorly (retina) [4]. When the eyeball rotates about its axis, it generates a large amplitude electric signal which is detectable by any electrodes near the eye known as Electrooculogram [5]. Figure 3 shows, when the eyeball rotates closer to FP1 electrode and produces a positive deflection. Similarly, when the eyeball rotates downwards the positive pole (cornea) becomes far away from Fp1 (Closet to the reference electrode) produce negative deflection. This is like what happens when the eye blinks. When the eyelid closes, the Cornea becomes closer to Fp1 and a positive deflection is produced. But when the eyelid opens the cornea rotate away from Fp1 and a negative deflection is produced as shown in figure 3.

## Proposed System

Any human brain interface system consists of mainly four primary modules: data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction and classifier module. The followings are the techniques and methodology used in this research experiment. MATLAB and Python are the tools which were used to analyze and verify the results. Different classifications techniques were implemented in the python to find the accuracy. 

### 1. Data Acquisition
Emotive Headset and OPENBCI headwear is used. Each headset consists of an ear clip with electrodes. Data acquisition is a critical process, and one should acquire data that is free from external and internal artifacts. Bio-potentials collection methods can be classified into three categories: invasive, semi-invasive, and non-invasive [9]. The most invasive technique is called deep brain recording. In this case, a microelectrode is placed inside the skull and signals can be recorded from very well-defined locations. For semi-invasive little to no surgery is required to implant in the desired location. For non-invasive no surgery is required, simply it can be put in the skull readily and fast. The source of bio-potentials (neuron) is far in the case of non-invasive electrodes, this technique is more prone to error and signal loss.

### 2. Signal processing
The raw data from the headset which needs to be further processed. Extracting discriminative characteristics from EEG recordings may be a challenging task, due to the significant presence of artifacts in the acquired data [10]. Different physiologic artifacts like Alternating Current Artifact, Electrode Artifacts, Movements in Recording Environment, Interference of Other equipment, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Skin Artifact are present in the EEG signals [11].

### 3. Feature Extraction
Feature extraction is a process of dimensionality reduction by which an initial set of raw data is reduced to more manageable groups for processing. A characteristic of these large data sets has many variables that require a lot of computing resources to process. The eye blinks were extracted from EEG using the following criterion. Eye blink has the largest amplitude in EEG signal so can be detect easily [11][12]. Also, the amplitude of these peaks will be significantly higher compared to the rhythmic brain activity. An eye-blink signal can be detected by its positive and negative peak occurrences. By examining it was found that the positive peak of eye blink is always greater than 0.3 and the negative one is smaller than -0.3 (after normalization) [11]. The eye blink signals are characterized by high value of kurtosis coefficient, normally above the value 3 [11][13]. MATLAB was used to detect the peak and to analyze and determine whether the signal is eye blink or not. Only useful data was analyzed and passed into different techniques like Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Machine Learning Algorithms to determine the signal a blink or not.

### 3. Classification
The design of classifier is a hot topic in EEG data processing and applications. Traditional methods for EEG classifier design face the challenge caused by high dimension of EEG data sets, thus the classification result may have large deviations. Small sample size problem of EEG could lead to the overfitting phenomenon, which limits the application of traditional classifier. In this research, I have applied different binary classifications like Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Algorithms to determine whether the EEG signal is associated with eye blink or not. The detailed explanation of these techniques is discussed in the following sections.
