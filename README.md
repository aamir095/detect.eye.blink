# Eye Blinking EEG Signal Analysis Using Brain Computer Interface Devices 

Abstract‚Äî In this paper, electroencephalogram signals were acquired and analyzed during different physical activities like rest, anger, and eye blinking. The eye blinking artifact in electroencephalogram signal is studied and analyzed. For this purpose, an Open-Source Brain-Computer Interface device is used for the acquisition of electroencephalogram signals from a single subject (me). The brain waves were acquired at a regular interval, and around 142 instances of eyeblinks were recorded. Eyeblinks preprocessing was done in MATLAB using Butterworth filters. I have developed the algorithm to find the duration of eye blink using MATLAB. Also, I have applied various techniques like Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Machine Learning Algorithm (Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Algorithms) to determine the EEG signals were eyeblink signals or not. Among all the techniques and algorithms, Random Forest Classifier has the highest accuracy.

## Introduction
The human brain is one the most complex system found in our body, and an exacting task to understand the brain, brainwaves. Different techniques have been evolved from past to understand the brainwaves. Among them the most used technique is Electroencephalogram. Both invasive and non-invasive EEG recording have an increasing role in neuroscience and brain computer devices interfaces. The invasive devices should be inserted in brain by surgery while non-invasive devices can be easily fit into the scalp. Using non- invasive devices is a simple and fast process to analyzing the brain activities. However, signal quality from invasive devices is 20 to above 100 times better than the simultaneously obtained from non-invasive devices [1]. While dealing with eye blink and movements EEG signals, the use of non-invasive devices has significant signal quality as compared to the invasive devices. Comparing blink related artifacts in non-invasive and invasive EEG, simultaneously recorded from prefrontal and motor cortical regions using an approach suitable for detection of small artifact contamination. As expected, it is found that blinks to cause pronounced artifacts in non-invasive EEG both above prefrontal and motor cortical regions [1]. In this experiment we have used non-invasive devices from OPENBCI and Emotiv to analyze brainwaves. We are more focused in analyzing brain activities due to eye movements and controlling other devices like RC car, drone using brain waves.

EEG signal is bio-potential generated from brain activities, represented as voltage (very small in magnitude) fluctuations from ionic movement of neurons within the brain [2]. Depending on brain activities different magnitude and frequency of signals are generated from brain. The amplitude of the EEG signals ranges between 10 - 200 V with a frequency falling in the range 0.5 - 40Hz. EEG waveform is classified into five different frequency bands (alpha, beta, theta, delta, and gamma bands) [3]. Delta (ùõø) waves (0.5 -4Hz) are the slowest EEG waves, normally detected during the deep and unconscious sleep. Theta (∆ü) waves (4 - 8Hz) are observe- d during some states of sleep and quiet focus. Alpha (Œ±) band (8 - 14Hz) originates during periods of relaxation with eyes closed but still awake. Beta (Œ≤) band (14 - 30Hz) originates during normal consciousness and active concern- traction. Finally, Gamma (Œ≥) waves (over 30Hz) are known to have stronger electrical signals in response to visual stimulation. Fig.1 shows the five frequency bands of EEG signal. Different acquisition protocols have been tested for human recognition tasks such as relaxation with eye closed, EEG recordings based on visual stimuli, and performing mental tasks. In this paper we analyze the eye moment activities and corresponding signals generated from the brain. 
The brain-waves signals are extracted, and signal processed from BCI devices. The processed signal is transferred to the computer via Bluetooth, or any medium and feature selection processed of obtained discrete signal is handled with MATLAB. Figure 2 shows the proposed block diagram of the system. The eyeball acts as a dipole with a positive pole oriented anteriorly (cornea) and a negative pole oriented posteriorly (retina) [4]. When the eyeball rotates about its axis, it generates a large amplitude electric signal which is detectable by any electrodes near the eye known as Electrooculogram [5]. Figure 3 shows, when the eyeball rotates closer to FP1 electrode and produces a positive deflection. Similarly, when the eyeball rotates downwards the positive pole (cornea) becomes far away from Fp1 (Closet to the reference electrode) produce negative deflection. This is like what happens when the eye blinks. When the eyelid closes, the Cornea becomes closer to Fp1 and a positive deflection is produced. But when the eyelid opens the cornea rotate away from Fp1 and a negative deflection is produced as shown in figure 3.
